# ausmith's dotfiles

Storing my dotfiles on github is generally the right way to go.
Using what is likely an overcomplicated setup script, this repo
can do a comparison against the already setup config file that
is about to be replaced and give that info before running.

## Why do something different?

1. I wanted to store my gitconfig in github without including
settings specific to my git username
2. ...
3. Profit
